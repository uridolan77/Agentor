# LLM Gateway Security Features

This document provides an overview of the security features implemented in the LLM Gateway.

## Security Components

The LLM Gateway includes the following security components:

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

### 4. Security Headers

The `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` adds security headers to all responses:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

# Create user manager
user_manager = UserManager(jwt_auth=jwt_auth)

# Create a user
user = await user_manager.create_user(
    username="john",
    email="john@example.com",
    password="password123",
    roles=[Role.USER]
)

# Authenticate a user
user = await user_manager.authenticate("john", "password123")

# Create tokens
